# Module 9: Surf's Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval
## Resources

- **Data Sources:** 
  - Hawaii SQLite Database [hawaii.sqlite](Resources/hawaii.sqlite)
- **Software:** Python, SQLAlchemy, JupyterLab, SQLite, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Flask

## Challenge Project Overview 

Using tools such as SQLAlchemy, Python, and JupyterLab, I connected to and queried an SQLite database. Then I wrote and executed Python code using Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas to view statistics like minimum, maximum, and averages to analyze and visualize the data about weather. Finally, I built a basic Flask app to view the JSONified data. With this data, we could locate an ideal surf shop location
