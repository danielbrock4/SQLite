# SQLite
Using tools such as SQLAlchemy, Python, and JupyterLab, I connected to and queried an SQLite database. Then I wrote and executed Python code using Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas to view statistics like minimum, maximum, and averages to analyze and visualize the data about weather. Finally, I built a basic flask app to view the JSONified data. With this data, we could locate an ideal surf shop location
