    "# Getting Started with SQLite\n",
    "SQLite provides a quick way to setup a database engine without requiring a server. It's essentially a flat file, but with most of the major capabilities of an SQL database. You can compare SQLite databases to a CSV or Excel file: each SQLite database can have one or more tables with columns and rows, and it is stored as a file on your computer. The key difference between SQLite databases and a CSV or Excel file is that we can write queries for it.\n",
    "#### SQLite Advantages\n",
    "* *It's local.* - One of the core advantages of SQLite is that it allows you to create databases locally on your computer to support testing and easy prototyping. This is beneficial, because if you want to test something out and you need a database, it's not always the most convenient to set up a SQL database server just to try something out.\n",
    "* *There's an app for that.* -  Another advantage of SQLite databases are that they can be used on a mobile phone app. Most mobile phone games will use an SQLite database to store certain information about you or your players statistics.\n",
    "#### SQLite Disadvantages\n",
    "* *It's local.* -  If you've used a MYSQL database before, you might have noticed that you can have multiple users access the database. With SQLite, there are no users. SQL is local: stored on one computer or phone. So, only that computer or phone will have access.\n",
    "* *There are fewer security features:*  -  one other disadvantage to be aware of is that SQLite doesn't have as many security features as a traditional SQL database."
